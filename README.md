**ðŸ“š Library Management System â€“ SQL Project**
A complete Library Management System built in PostgreSQL with schema design, sample data, CRUD operations, and analytical queries.

**ðŸ”¹ Project Overview**
  Database Schema Design: Branches, Employees, Books, Members, Issued Books, and Returned Books. 
  Data Integrity: Primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints applied. 
  Sample Data: Rich dataset of books, employees, members, and transactions. 
  Operations Included: Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) 
  Analytical queries (rental income, overdue books, branch performance, etc.) 
  CTAS (Create Table As Select) for reporting

**ðŸ”¹ File Structure**
  Library_management.sql â†’ Main SQL script (schema, data, queries)
  ERD_Library.JPG â†’ Entity Relationship Diagram
  books.csv â†’ Sample dataset of books
  branch.csv â†’ Sample dataset of branches
  employees.csv â†’ Sample dataset of employees
  members.csv â†’ Sample dataset of library members
  issued_status.csv â†’ Sample dataset of issued books
  return_status.csv â†’ Sample dataset of returned books
  
**ðŸ”¹ Database Schema (ERD)**
The ER diagram shows relationships between entities such as Books, Members, Employees, Branches, Issued books, and Return records.

**ðŸ”¹ How to Run**
  1. Clone the repository: 
              https://github.com/Jyo0697/Library_Management_System
  2. Open pgAdmin 4 or connect to your PostgreSQL database.
  3. Run the Library_management.sql script to:
  4. Create tables
  5. Insert sample data
  6. Run CRUD operations
  7. Generate reports and analytical queries

**ðŸ”¹ Example Analytical Queries** 
  Total rental income by category 
  Overdue books (with assumed 500-day return period) 
  Branch performance report (books issued, books returned, revenue) 
  Active members in the last 2 years 
  Expensive books (rental > 7.0)

**ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack** 
  PostgreSQL 
  pgAdmin 4 (for ERD and execution)

**ðŸ”¹ Use Case** 
This project is a great resource for: 
    SQL learners practicing end-to-end projects 
    Data Analysts building portfolio projects 
    Business Analysts understanding how queries drive insights
